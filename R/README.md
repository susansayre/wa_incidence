# Descriptions of code files

The core code containing the functions needed to run the data analysis pipeline as well as the code needed to generate figures and tables once the pipeline has been run are stored here.

prepare_input_data.R generates several prepared_data files that are not included in the replication archive from raw data stored in data-raw. See data-raw/README.md for descriptions of how to downloaded and store the necessary data.
